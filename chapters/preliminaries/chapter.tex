\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{ch:preliminaries}

This preliminary chapter serves the purposes of introducing fundamental notation that will be used throughout this thesis. In doing so, we will provide a brief rundown of theorems and algorithms on which the techniques described in later chapters are building upon. For a more detailed introduction to the topics covered in this chapter, we refer to Chapter 1 of the book \textit{Branch-and-Price} by Desrosiers et al. \cite{thebook}.
