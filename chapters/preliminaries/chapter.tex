\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{ch:preliminaries}

In this preliminary chapter we will provide a brief rundown of theorems and algorithms on which the techniques described in later chapters, such as Column Generation in Section \ref{sec:cg_bp_cg}, are building upon. Understanding these concepts is essential to understanding the theory later presented. If, however, one is familiar with these, we invite the reader to skip ahead to Chapter \ref{ch:cg_bp}.
