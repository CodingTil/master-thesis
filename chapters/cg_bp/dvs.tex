\section{Dual Value Stabilization}\label{sec:cg_bp_dvs}
During column generation, it has been observed that the dual values oscillate erratically, which means it takes more column generation iterations to generate columns that are considered profitable. One can, however, stabilize the dual values, decreasing such oscillations, resulting in a significant performance improvement of the column generation algorithm. This section covers the fundamentals of the hybridization of the dynamic alpha-schedule stabilization with an ascent method, as proposed by Possea et al., for which we will introduce the building blocks step by step. For more detail, we refer to \cite{pessoa2013out,pessoa2018automation}.
