\chapter{Component Bound Branching}\label{ch:cmpbnd}
In this chapter, we introduce the \textbf{component bound branching rule} (\texttt{COMPBND}) for branching on the master variables of the discretized reformulation of any type of bounded \IP{}. This new branching rule builds upon the fundamental ideas of Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme (Section \ref{sec:cg_bp_bp_branching_generic}), aiming to provide a simpler alternative to branching on component bounds. We will begin by demonstrating how to enforce component bounds to create a binary branch-and-bound search tree. Next, we will delve into the algorithm responsible for determining suitable branching decisions. Finally, we will compare and contrast Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme with our new approach, highlighting their similarities and differences.
