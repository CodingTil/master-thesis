\chapter{Component Bound Branching}\label{ch:cmpbnd}
In this chapter, we introduce the \textbf{component bound branching rule} (\texttt{COMPBND}) for branching on the master variables of the discretized reformulation of any type of bounded \IP{}. This branching rule, initially formalized by Desrosiers et al. in \cite{thebook}, builds upon the fundamental ideas of Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme (Section \ref{sec:cg_bp_bp_branching_master}), offering a simpler alternative to branching on component bounds. We will first demonstrate how to enforce component bounds to create a binary search tree. Then, we will explore the algorithm responsible for determining suitable branching decisions. Finally, we will compare and contrast Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme with our new approach, highlighting their similarities and differences.
