\section{Test Set of Instances}\label{sec:evaluation_testset}
To evaluate the component bound branching rule and to compare it to Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme, we require a test set of mixed integer instances. As not to skew the results, we restrict ourselves to instances where \GCG{} itself chooses to solve these using the generic branching scheme, or equivalently component bound branching. This is important, as the generic branching scheme is not always the best choice, and the solver might choose to use other branching rules.

To create such a test set, we have filtered the \texttt{strIPlib} \cite{strIPlib} collection for instances that were once solved using the generic branching scheme, generating a test set of 1053 mixed integer instances. Unfortunately, the metadata of the instances in \texttt{striplib} was generated using an older version of \GCG{}. In the current version, generic branching might in fact not even be applied to these instances anymore. Therefore, we have post-processed these instances, removing any from the test set that are no longer solved using the generic branching scheme. This leaves us with a test set of 736 mixed integer instances, consisting of cutting stock and scheduling problems in various sizes and formulations.
