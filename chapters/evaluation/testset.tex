\section{Test Set of Instances}\label{sec:evaluation_testset}
To evaluate the component bound branching rule and compare it to Vanderbeck's generic branching scheme, we assembled a test set of mixed integer instances. We focused on instances where \GCG{} itself chooses the generic branching scheme or the component bound branching rule, ensuring our evaluation is not skewed by forcing such branching on instances.

To create this test set, we filtered the \texttt{strIPlib} collection \cite{strIPlib} for instances previously solved using the generic branching scheme, resulting in an initial set of 1053 mixed integer instances. However, the metadata for these instances was generated with an older version of \GCG{}, which may not reflect the current solver's behavior. Consequently, we post-processed these instances, removing those no longer solved using the generic branching scheme. This refinement yielded a final test set of 736 mixed integer instances, primarily comprising cutting stock and scheduling problems in various sizes and formulations.
