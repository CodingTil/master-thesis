\section{Dual Value Stabilization for Generic Mastercuts}\label{sec:gm_dvs}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:cg_bp_dvs}, the hybrid ascent dual value stabilization method implemented in \GCG{} requires subgradients of the Lagrangian function to update the dual values. These subgradients are precisely the violations of the complicating constraints in the pricing problem, represented by $\left( \vec{b} - \mat{A} \vec{x}^* \right)$ for a given pricing solution $\vec{x}^*$. Here, $\mat{A} \vec{x}^*$ represents the column coefficients for the constraints in the master problem.

To stabilize the dual value $\gamma$ of a generic mastercut (Definition \ref{def:gm}), we use the same principle. The violation of a generic mastercut is given by $\left( f - y^* \right)$. Utilizing this violation as a subgradient aligns with the idea of refining our estimate of the optimal dual values by moving in the direction indicated by this violation. Thus, by determining the violation $\left( f - y^* \right)$, we can apply the existing hybrid ascent dual value stabilization method to generic mastercuts effectively.
