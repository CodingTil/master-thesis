\section{Dual Value Stabilization for Generic Mastercuts}\label{sec:gm_dvs}
As we have discussed in Section \ref{sec:cg_bp_dvs}, the hybrid ascent dual value stabilization method which is implemented in \GCG{} requires subgradients of the Lagrangian function to update the dual values. We have seen that these subgradients are exactly the violation of the complicating constraints in the pricing problem, i.e., $\left( \vec{b} - \mat{A} \vec{x}^* \right)$ for some pricing solution $\vec{x}^*$. Considering that $\mat{A} \vec{x}^*$ denotes the column coefficients for the constraints in the master problem, we apply this very same construct in order to stabilize the dual value $\gamma$ of a generic mastercut (Definition \ref{def:gm}). Its violation is given by $\left( f - y^* \right)$. Again, using this violation as a subgradient intuitively is consistent with the idea that we want to improve our estimate of the optimal dual values by moving in the direction of this violation. In this way, simply by determining this violation, we can apply the already implemented hybrid ascent dual value stabilization method to generic mastercuts.
