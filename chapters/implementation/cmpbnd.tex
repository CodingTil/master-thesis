\section{Component Bound Branching}\label{sec:cmpbnd}
We have implemented the component bound branching rule as described in Chapter \ref{ch:cmpbnd} in \GCG{}. To enforce its branching decisions, which involve adding constraints and variables to the subproblem, we have used the new generic mastercut interface. Besides this, there is nothing noteworthy to add to the implementation of the branching rule itself. The branching rule is now fully integrated into the \GCG{} framework and can be used as any other branching rule.
